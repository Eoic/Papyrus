## Conclusion

Papyrus has a clear opportunity in the e-book management market by addressing unmet needs:

1. **Cross-platform consistency** that ecosystem players can't provide
2. **Privacy and data ownership** that cloud services don't prioritize
3. **Modern UX** that Calibre lacks
4. **E-ink support** that mobile apps ignore

By focusing on these differentiators and targeting privacy-conscious, multi-device readers first, Papyrus can establish a loyal user base before expanding to mainstream adoption.
