Implement a Python 3.12 REST API server using FastAPI based on the OpenAPI specification file located at ../docs/src/api/openapi.yaml. The server project should use pyproject.toml for dependencies and be imlemented in ../server directory. Do NOT skip any endpoints, schemas, or parameters from the spec. The generated server must be a complete 1:1 match of the OpenAPI contract. Please DO use relevant agents, MCPs and skills at your disposal to help with Python, architecture, refactoring, database interactions and so on. For now, the endpoints can return example data, rather than having fully fledged implementations. Output <promise>TESTS COMPLETE</promise> when coverage > 50% and all endpoints are implemented.
