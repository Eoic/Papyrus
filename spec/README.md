# What is Papyrus?

Papyrus is a cross-platform software for managing electronic books and other documents.

**Integrated reader**

Customizable document viewer allows the user to view books and documents in various formats and adjust some aspects of the page display - font style and size, background and text color, spacing between lines and page borders. User may select from the available profiles or create their own. Reading progress such as time and pages is tracked automatically and may be turned on and off. Added book files and their reading progress are synchronized across all devices automatically.

**Bookmarking**

User can highlight any text and create bookmark from it. Clicking on the bookmark will open the relevant page of the book. This can be useful for either creating a hyperlink to the page user may want to revisit later or when saving certain quotes or important terms from the book.&#x20;

**Organizing books**

Adding, deleting, converting to and from different formats, editing metadata (including cover images). Full text search allows the user to quickly find relevant books and their pages. Books can be grouped into categories and contain multiple tags for faster search and more sophisticated categorization.

Categories may also contain books meeting certain conditions such as "Release date is later than 1950" or "Contains less than 100 pages". Category conditions can be defined using a query language or graphically by selecting certain values from the list.

**Goals and statistics**

The user can create reading goals such as "Read 1 hour per day for X days" or "Read at least 10 pages per day". All created challenges (can be either in a completed and failed state) are saved and can be previewed in a separate panel. Information such as total amount of time spent reading the books, added and finished books is tracked and can be viewed in a separate statistics panel although this information is available for each book separately.
