# What is Papyrus?

Papyrus aims to provide a versatile, easy-to-use system that enhances the reading experience. It's designed to be accessible on a wide range of platforms, including Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop, featuring an intuitive, modern UI with ample customization options.

### Key Features

* **Cross-platform:** manage physical and electronic books seamlessly across devices.
* **Integrated e-book viewer:** customize your reading experience with various look-and-feel options.
* **Flexible management:** organize books into shelves, categories, attach tags, create custom filters.
* **Progress tracking:** track reading time and books read, plan and create custom reading goals.
* **File uploads:** easily add new books.

### Why?

Many solutions offer some reading functionalities but fall short on some essential features or user experience. Papyrus aims to deliver a comprehensive solution that balances functionality with good user experience, covering all your reading needs in one application.

**Organize books:**

* Convert books to and from different formats.
* Edit metadata, perform full-text search, group books into categories, and add tags for quick search.
* Categories may include conditions like "Release date is after 1950" or "Contains fewer than 100 pages."
* Define category conditions using a query language or graphically by selecting values from a list.

**Create reading goals:**

* Set goals like "Read X books in 6 months from today" or "Read at least 1 hour per day."

**Take notes and create annotations:**

* Take notes, create bookmarks, and highlight relevant text sections.

**Customize the reader:**

* Choose font, font size, background, foreground, character, word spacing, layout and much more.
* Save custom look-and-feel profiles.

**Track reading progress:**

* Track the number of books read and time spent reading.
* Synchronize reading progress with the server, allowing you to continue from any device.

**Track physical and e-books:**

* Upload e-books and choose storage options: locally, on a local server, or in the cloud.
* Optionally track physical books for added detail.
