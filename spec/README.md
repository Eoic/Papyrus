# What is Papyrus?

Papyrus is a cross-platform software for managing your physical and electronic books seamlessly, across a wide range of devices. Nowadays there is no shortage of software solutions offering some of the functionality a regular reader may require - an integrated e-book viewer, some way of categorization (e.g. shelves, categories, tags), statistics tracking (e.g. reading time, number of books read), file uploads, and so on. Yet, one could argue that each of the mentioned solutions leaves a lot to be desired, mainly because while doing a subset of things well, some other, arguably essential, functionality is missing or the UX is just not good.

Papyrus is an attempt to make a versatile, easy-to-use system that would enhance the reading experience, and make it more accessible by working on a diverse range of platforms - Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, etc., with intuitive and modern UI, customization options, and a wide range of functionality.&#x20;

## **Main features**

1. **Track physical books and e-books -** upload e-books and choose where the files and related data are being stored, whether locally, on a local server, or in the cloud. While not essential, keeping track of your physical books can also be a nice touch.&#x20;
2. **Track reading progress -** reading progress is synchronized with the server, whenever possible, so you can always continue where you left off, from any device.
3. **View reading statistics -** track how many books you read and how much time you spent reading.&#x20;
4. **Customize the reader -** choose the font, font size, background, foreground, character, and word spacing, and save your look-and-feel profiles to make the editor look the way you want to.&#x20;
5. **Take notes and create annotations -** take notes, create bookmarks, and highlight relevant text sections.
6. **Create reading goals -** create reading goals such as "Read X books in 6 months from starting from today." or "Read at least 1 hour per day". The intention is not to provide the means of forcing yourself to read (it could, of course, work as a way of commitment), as reading should be interesting and a joyful, relaxing experience, but more as a reminder, a gentle nudge reminding of what you are.&#x20;
7. **Organize books - convert** to and from different formats, edit metadata, do full-text search, group books into categories, and add tags for quick search. Categories may also contain books meeting certain conditions such as "Release date is later than 1950" or "Contains less than 100 pages". Category conditions can be defined using a query language or graphically by selecting certain values from the list.
