# Requirements

This section contains the complete requirements specification for Papyrus, organized into functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements define what the system must do and how it must perform.

## Overview

The requirements are structured to support the development of a comprehensive cross-platform book management system that prioritizes:

- **User data ownership** - Users control their data and storage preferences
- **Cross-platform accessibility** - Seamless experience across all devices
- **Offline functionality** - Core features available without internet connection
- **Developer friendliness** - Self-hostable and extensible architecture
- **Reading-focused design** - Optimized for comfortable reading experience

## Requirement categories

### [Functional requirements](functional-requirements.md)
Define what the system must do - the features and capabilities that users can interact with directly. These include user management, book organization, reading features, progress tracking, and data management.

### [Non-functional requirements](non-functional-requirements.md)
Define how the system must perform - the quality attributes, constraints, and technical specifications that ensure the system meets performance, reliability, and usability standards.

## Traceability

Each requirement is uniquely identified and traceable to:
- **Use cases** - Detailed scenarios showing how requirements are implemented
- **Actors** - User types who interact with the requirement
- **Design decisions** - Architecture and implementation choices
- **Test scenarios** - Validation criteria for requirement fulfillment

## Requirement notation

Requirements use the following notation:
- **FR-X.Y** - Functional requirement (section X, item Y)
- **NFR-X.Y** - Non-functional requirement (section X, item Y)
- **UC-X.Y** - Use case (section X, item Y)

Cross-references between requirements and use cases are provided throughout the documentation to maintain traceability and ensure comprehensive coverage.
