# Papyrus
Papyrus is an attempt to make a versatile, easy-to-use system that would enhance the reading experience, and make it more accessible by working on a diverse range of platforms - Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, etc., with intuitive and modern UI, customization options, and a wide range of functionality. 

### Main features
1. **Track physical books and e-books** - upload e-books and choose where the files and related data are being stored, whether locally, on a local server, or in the cloud. It can also work as a tool for keeping track of your physical books - just fill in the metadata of the book you want to track.
2. **Track reading progress** - reading progress is synchronized with the server, whenever possible, so you can always continue where you left off.
3. **View reading statistics** - track how many books you read and how much time you spent reading. 
4. **Customize the reader** - choose the font, font size, background, foreground, character, and word spacing, and save your look-and-feel profiles to make the editor look the way you want to. 
5. **Take notes and create annotations** - take notes, create bookmarks, and highlight relevant text sections.
6. **Create reading goals** - create reading goals such as "Read X books in 6 months from starting from today." or "Read at least 1 hour per day". The intention is not to provide the means of forcing yourself to read, as reading should be interesting and a joyful, relaxing experience, but more as a reminder.
7. **Organize books** - convert to and from different formats, edit metadata, do full-text search, group books into categories, and add tags for quick search. Categories may also contain books meeting certain conditions such as "Release date is later than 1950" or "Contains less than 100 pages". Category conditions can be defined using a query language or graphically by selecting certain values from the list.
